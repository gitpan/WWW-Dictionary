============================

=head1 NAME

WWW::Dictionary - Interface with www.dictionary.com

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WWW::Dictionary;

    my $dictionary = WWW::Dictionary->new();

    my $meaning = $dictionary->meaning( $word );

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

Creates a new WWW::Dictionary object.

If passed an expression, sets that expression to the current one.

  my $dictionary = WWW::Dictionary->new();

or

  my $dictionary = WWW::Dictionary->new('current expression');

=head2 set_expression

Sets the current expression to look for (doesn't look, merely sets the expression).

  $dictionary->set_expression('new expression');

Returns the same expression.

=head2 get_expression

Returns the current expression.

  my $expression = $dictionary->get_expression();

=head2 get_meaning

Returns the meaning of the current expression by fetching from
www.dictionary.com.

If the expression has already been fetched (if it still has the
information stored), returns what is already on memory.

  my $meaning = $dictionary->get_meaning();

You can also pass a new expression, which is set to be the current
expression before fetching is made:

  my $meaning = $dictionary->get_meaning('some other expression');

=head2 set_meaning

Sets a meaning in the object dictionary.

  $dictionary->set_meaning( $word, $meaning );

From this point on (until a C<reset_dictionary> is called), retrieving
the meaning of $word will return whatever was on $meaning.

=head2 get_dictionary

Returns the current dictionary inside the object.

  my %dictionary = %{ $dictionary->get_dictionary };

=head2 reset_dictionary

Resets the current dictionary.

  $dictionary->reset_dictionary;
